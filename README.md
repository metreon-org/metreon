# metreon
Metreon is a statically typed Domain Specific Language (DSL) that aims to verify execution contexts, effects, ownership, resource lifecycles, and asynchronous protocol topology in low-level GPU pipelines

## Run the frontend examples

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --parallel
./build/metreonc --emit=graphir examples/contexts.mtr
./build/metreonc --emit=graphir examples/resources.mtr
./build/metreonc --emit=graphir examples/accumulators.mtr
./build/metreonc --emit=graphir examples/kernel_variables.mtr
./build/metreonc --emit=graphir examples/procedures.mtr
cat tmp/graphir/procedures.graphir
```

The compiler saves GraphIR to `tmp/graphir/` relative to its current working
directory and prints only the saved path. For example, running from `compiler/`
produces `compiler/tmp/graphir/procedures.graphir`, while invoking
`compiler/build/metreonc` from the parent directory produces
`tmp/graphir/procedures.graphir` in that parent directory. The output location
does not depend on the source file or executable location. When running inside
this checkout, the existing `/tmp/` rule in `.gitignore` excludes the generated
artifacts; other working directories use their own ignore rules.

The default invocation and `--emit=graphir` both save a file. Reading from stdin
with `-` produces `stdin.graphir`. Recompiling the same input stem replaces its
previous output; inputs in different directories with the same stem share that
output filename. Source validation finishes before opening the output file, so
invalid programs do not replace a previous artifact. Directory or file-write
failures produce an error and a nonzero exit status.

The current compiler parses and validates `.mtr` context declarations and
resource state machines, kernels, and procedures, then emits textual GraphIR
with context metadata, resource graphs, and ordered callable bodies. Procedures
support typed parameters and return types, resource-transition calls, nested
blocks, and execution-context/effect requirements. It does not yet generate or execute runtime or GPU code.
